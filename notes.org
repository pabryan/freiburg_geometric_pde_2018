- Single loop with \(k\) nodes.
- Unbound lines asymptotically flat or boundary lying on \(\partial \Omega\) (\(\Omega\) convex body) \pause
- At each node, angles: \(2\pi/3\)
- Triple condition:
  \[
  \ip{T^+}{-T^-} = -\frac{1}{2}
  \]

- Skeleton = polygon formed from nodes
- For this talk, restrict to networks symmetric under dihedral group \(D_k\)
- Skeleton is preserved along the flow (up to scaling) since \(D_k\) acts by isometry

* Network CSF

** Curve Shortening of Networks

\[
\ip{\partial_t \gamma}{N} = -\kappa \Rightarrow \partial_t \gamma = - \kappa N + v T
\]

\pause

- At a node: \(-\kappa^+ N^+ + v^+ T^+ = -\kappa^- N^- + v^- T^-\)
- At a node, can solve for \(v\) in terms of \(\kappa\):
  \[
  v^+ = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \kappa^- - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \kappa^+, \quad v^- = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \kappa^+ + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \kappa^-
  \]
  \pause
- Corner speed difference:
  \[
  \Delta v = v^+ - v^- = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} (\kappa^- + \kappa^+)
  \]

** Evolution Equations

Evolution equations differ from smooth case:

\[
[\partial_s, \partial_t] = -(\partial_s v - \kappa^2) \partial_s
\]
\pause

- \(\partial_t \kappa = \partial_s^2 \kappa + \kappa^3 + v \partial_s \kappa\) \pause
- \(\partial_t \ell(p,q) = \Delta Q(p, q) + v(q) - v(p)\)
  - \(\Delta Q(p, q) := -\int_p^q \kappa^2 ds + \sum_{i \in I(p,q)} \Delta v_i\)
  - \(I(p,q)\) sum over nodes between \(p\) and \(q\) \pause
- \(\partial_t L = \bar{Q}\)
  - \(\bar{Q} := - \int_{\gamma} \kappa^2 ds + \sum_{i=1}^k \Delta v_i\) \pause
- \(\partial_t \text{Area} = -(2 - k/3)\pi + \sum \ip{\gamma}{\kappa_i^+ T_i^+ - \kappa_i^- T_i^-}\)

** Remarks on convexity, contraction/expansion

Recall \(\partial_t \text{Area} = -(2 - k/3)\pi + \sum \ip{\gamma}{\kappa_i^+ T_i^+ - \kappa_i^- T_i^-}\)

- For \(k > 6\), the first term could be positive and area increases. Expanding!
\pause

Gauss-Bonnet: \(\int_{\gamma} \kappa = (2-k/3) \pi\).

- For \(k=6\): \(\int_{\gamma} \kappa = 0\).
- Convexity occurs only for polygonal solutions! \pause
- Self-sim solution is in fact a static regular hexagon.
- Perturb unbounded lines should break convexity hence it's unstable! \pause
- But it is stable under \(D_k\) preserving perturbations of the loop. \pause

No convex networks for \(k > 6\)!

Self similar solutions Chen-Guo '07
- There exists a unique \(D_k\) symmetric self-similar network \pause
- Fish and Rocket in 2 and 3 nodes resp. are the only non-\(D_k\) symmetric self similar solutions

** Some Theorems

- Existence/uniqueness derived from local version by Bronsard-Reitich '93 \pause
- Schnurer, Schulze, Saez et. al '11 proved convex networks with $k=2$ converge to self-similar (dist. comp.) \pause
- CSF of graphs with prescribed angles converges to self-simlar Chen-Guo '11
  - Therefore \(D_k\) graphs converge to self-similar (not observed in the literature!) \pause
- See excellent article by Mantegazza-Novoga-Pluda-Schulze

* Chord-arc profile

** Chord-arc Profile

#+BEGIN_definition
\(Z(x) = \frac{L_k}{L} \inf \{d(p, q) : \ell(p,q) = \frac{L}{L_k} x\}\) for \(x \in [0, L_k]\)
#+END_definition

- \(L_k\) is canonical self-similar length \(\ip{\gamma}{N} = \kappa\). \pause
- Non-\(D_k\) symmetric: include some terms for unbounded lines \pause

#+BEGIN_lemma
\[
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\chordarcprofile(x) - \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x}{x^2} = -\frac{1}{16} \frac{L}{L_k} \max_i \{\curvecurv^+(a_i) + \curvecurv^-(a_i)\}
\]
#+END_lemma

** The smooth case

Network case
\[
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\chordarcprofile(x) - \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x}{x^2} = -\frac{1}{16} \frac{L}{L_k} \max_i \{\curvecurv^+(a_i) + \curvecurv^-(a_i)\}
\]
\pause

The smooth case
\[
\lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\chordarcprofile(x) - x}{x^3} = - \frac{1}{24} \left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^2 \max_{\gamma} \kappa^2
\]
\pause

- Concentration around maximum curvature! \pause
- Also note \(x^2\) instead of \(x^3\) occurs because the second derivative of \(d^2\) at a node picks up corner angle

** Concavity

#+BEGIN_definition
A /concave like point/ \(x = \ell(p,q)\) is one where there exists a concave lower barrier to \(\chordarcprofile\) and \(x\).
#+END_definition
\pause

#+ATTR_LATEX: :height .3\textheight
[[file:img/optimal_smooth.png]]

- Concave like points are regular (i.e. not nodes) \pause
- Topological considerations such as whether \({\color{green} w = \gamma(q) - \gamma(p)}\) points in or out and whether \(T_q = T_q\) or \(w\) bisects \(T_p\), \(T_q\) do not come into play at concave like points. \pause
- Compare smooth case (Andrews-B '09) and Huisken '95.

** Viscosity Equation for networks

#+BEGIN_lemma
 At concave like points:
\[
-\frac{\chordarcprofile''}{\sqrt{1-(\chordarcprofile')^2}} \geq -\frac{L}{8\pi} \left[\curvecurv_p + \curvecurv\right].
\]
#+END_lemma

\pause

- In general there are other terms but it's sufficient to consider only concave like points. \pause
- That is, if an evolving concave function lies below the evolving profile, the first touching point is concave like. \pause
- For convex networks, all points are concave like.

** CSF viscosity equation

#+BEGIN_theorem
Let $\gamma$ be the loop of a network evolving by the Curve Shortening Flow. Then at a concave like point points, the Chord-Arc profile $\gamma$ satisfies the following viscosity equation
\[
\partial_t \chordarcprofile \geq \left(\frac{L_k}{L}\right)^2 4 \chordarcprofile'' + \frac{1}{L} \bar{Q} \left(\chordarcprofile - x \chordarcprofile'\right) + \frac{L_k}{L} \Delta Q \chordarcprofile'.
\]
#+END_theorem

* Comparison
** Smooth CSF Comparison theorem (Andrews, B- '11)

#+BEGIN_theorem
If an evolving concave function \(\varphi\) touches \(Z\) at \(x_0, t_0\) from below, then
\[
\partial_t \varphi \leq 4 \left(\frac{L_k}{L}\right)^2 \varphi'' + \frac{1}{L} \bar{Q} (\varphi - x \varphi') + \frac{L_k}{L} \Delta Q \varphi'
\]
\pause

If in addition,
\[
\varphi_0(x, t) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} x - c(t) x^3 + \bigo(x^3) \quad \text{as} \quad x \to 0
\]
then
\[
\left(\frac{L}{2\pi}\right)^2 \max_{\gamma} \curvecurv^2 \leq c(t).
\]
#+END_theorem

** Network CSF Comparison theorem

#+BEGIN_theorem
If an evolving concave function \(\varphi\) touches \(Z\) at \(x_0, t_0\) from below, then
\[
\partial_t \varphi \leq 4 \left(\frac{L_k}{L}\right)^2 \varphi'' + \frac{1}{L} \bar{Q} (\varphi - x \varphi') + \frac{L_k}{L} \Delta Q \varphi'
\]
\pause

If in addition,
\[
\varphi_0(x, \tau) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} x - c(\tau) x^2 + \bigo(x^3) \quad \text{as} \quad x \to 0
\]
then
\[
\frac{L}{L_k} \max_i \{\curvecurv^+_i(t) + \curvecurv^-_i(t)\} \leq 16 c(\tau(t)).
\]
#+END_theorem

** Smooth Comparison Functions (Andrews, B- '11)

- Linearise around the self-similar solution (i.e. round circle), \(\psi_0 = 2 \sin(x/2)\)! \pause

Let
\[
\varphi(x, t) = e^t \Phi(e^{-t} \psi_0(x))
\]
where
\[
u \Phi'' + 2 (1 - \Phi')\Phi' = 0, \Phi(0) = 0. \quad u = e^{-t} \psi_0(x).
\]
\pause

- Then \(\varphi\) /automatically/ satisfies the comparison differential inequality with the correct asymptotics! \pause

- The *mysterious comparison function*
  \[
  \varphi(x, t) = e^t \Phi(e^{-t} \psi_0(x)) = C e^t \arctan((2/C) e^{-t} \sin(x/2)).
  \]

** Comparison Functions

- Linearise around the self-similar solution, \(\psi_0\)! \pause

Let
\[
\varphi(x, t) = e^t \Phi(e^{-t} \psi_0(x))
\]
where
\[
u \Phi'' + (1 - \Phi')\Phi' \geq 0, \Phi(0) = 0. \quad u = e^{-t} \psi_0(x).
\]
\pause

- Then \(\varphi\) satisfies the comparison differential inequality. \pause

- \(\Phi(u) = u + C u^3 + \bigo(u^4)\)
\[
\psi_0(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} x + a x^2 + \bigo(x^3).
\]
\pause

\[
\varphi(x, t) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} x + (a + C e^{-t}) x^2 + \bigo(x^3) \underset{t\to \infty}{\to} \psi_0(x)
\]

** Convergence Theorem

- We need some stability results of self-similar solutions which are not precise yet. Comparison of \(\Delta Q\) and \(\bar{Q}\) is sufficient. Self-similar is optimal.

- So we restrict to a \(D_k\) symmetric solutions in a "suitable" neighbourhood of the self-similar solution (we think this is the entire space!). Modulo these:

#+BEGIN_theorem
Let \(\gamma\) be a \(D_k\) symmetric network evolving under CSF. Then \(\gamma\) collapses to a point in finite time and rescaling to fix length, converges smoothly to the unique \(D_k\) self-similar solution.
#+END_theorem

\pause

- The theorem strictly enlarges the class of Chen-Guo which are only graphs over the skeleton.

** What's Next ?

- Obtain sharp stability requirements
- Account for the unbounded parts
- How to deal with the existence of non-symmetric self-similar solutions?
- Do singularities form or not?
- Distance comparison rules out higher multiplicity singularities: length must collapse for singularities to form!
